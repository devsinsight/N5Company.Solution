# N5Company.Solution

This is the solution for the exercise; everything was dockerized except the creation of the topics using ElasticsearchSinkConnector

Execute Docker Compose in Visual Studio

Run the two scripts in the Postman collection to create:
--Topic for Permissions
--Topic for Events (Operations: Get Modify Add)

Postman Collection: Elasticsearch-Sink.postman_collection.json

Once everything is ready, access to the UI: http://localhost:5173/

Enjoy!!
